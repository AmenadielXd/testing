Sometimes, you might trust a user not to send unwanted content.
Maybe not enough to make them admin, but you might be ok with locks, blacklists, and antiflood not applying to them.
That's what approvals are for - approve trustworthy users to allow them to send stuff without restrictions!

**Admin commands:**
 × /approval: Check a user's approval status in this chat.
 × /approve: Approve of a user. Locks, blacklists, and antiflood won't apply to them anymore.
 × /unapprove: Unapprove of a user. They will now be subject to blocklists.
 × /approved: List all approved users.
 × /unapproveall: Unapprove *ALL* users in a chat. This cannot be undone!
