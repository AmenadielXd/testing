Alita is a Telegram Group managment bot made using **[Pyrogram](https://docs.pyrogram.org) _async version_** and **[Python](https://python.org)**, which makes it modern and faster than most of the Telegram chat managers.

Help us bring more languages to the bot by contributing to the project in [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/alitarobot)!

**Alita's features over other bots:**
-   Modern
-   Fast
-   Fully asynchronous
-   Fully open-source
-   Frequently updated
-   Multi Language Support

Can be found on Telegram as [@AlitaBetaRobot](https://t.me/AlitaBetaRobot).

Alita is currently available in 5 Languages as of now: **en-US**, **pt-BR**, **it-IT**, **ru-RU**, **hi-IN**.
More languages can be managed in the _locales_ folder.

You need to have a *Postgres Database*, and *Redis Cache Database* as well!
